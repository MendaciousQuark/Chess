# Chess Engine with Self-play Capability
This personal project focuses on developing an AI-powered chess engine capable of playing against human players and itself. The primary objectives of this project are to enhance programming skills, demonstrate a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and showcase proficiency in utilizing GitHub for version control and collaboration.

# Key Features
- AI Gameplay: The chess engine will employ advanced algorithms and strategies to make intelligent moves and challenge human players.
- Self-play and Learning: The AI will be designed to play against itself, facilitating continuous learning and improvement through iterative gameplay.
- Programming Skill Development: This project serves as an opportunity to sharpen programming skills, particularly in implementing complex algorithms and data structures required for chess AI.
- Demonstration of OOP: The project will emphasize OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to ensure clean and       maintainable code.
- GitHub Showcase: Through this project, GitHub will be utilized for version control, collaboration, and demonstrating proficiency in using Git features like branches, pull requests, and issue tracking.
