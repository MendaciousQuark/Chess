# Chess Engine with Self-play Capability

This personal project focuses on developing an AI-powered chess engine capable of playing against human players and itself. The primary objectives of this project are to enhance programming skills, demonstrate a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and showcase proficiency in utilizing GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Key Features

### 1. AI Gameplay

- The chess engine employs advanced algorithms and strategies to make intelligent moves and challenge human players.
- It can provide a challenging opponent for players of various skill levels.

### 2. Self-play and Learning

- The AI is designed to play against itself, facilitating continuous learning and improvement through iterative gameplay.
- It learns from its past games, enabling it to adapt and make better decisions over time.

### 3. Programming Skill Development

- This project serves as an opportunity to sharpen programming skills, particularly in implementing complex algorithms and data structures required for chess AI.
- You can explore and experiment with various AI techniques and chess-related algorithms.

### 4. Demonstration of OOP

- The project emphasizes OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- It showcases well-structured classes and objects for representing chess pieces, the board, and game logic.

### 5. GitHub Showcase

- Throughout this project, GitHub is utilized for version control, collaboration, and demonstrating proficiency in using Git features like branches, pull requests, and issue tracking.
- The project's repository provides a detailed history of development and contributions.

## Current Capabilities

- Each piece in the chess engine is represented as an object capable of finding its own legal moves.
- The game state is controlled by the `Game` and `Board` classes, allowing for two human players to play against each other.
- The engine can detect checkmate and check conditions in the game.
- The AI can self-play, making moves based on its own evaluation function.
- The user interface (UI) is under development and not yet optimized for the best user experience.

## Next Steps

- Implement en passant move logic by tracking which pawns have just moved.
- Enhance the evaluation function for the chessboard to make more informed moves.
- Explore parallel processing to efficiently generate and evaluate multiple moves.
- Improve the user interface for a better gaming experience.

Stay tuned for further updates and enhancements as this chess engine project evolves!
